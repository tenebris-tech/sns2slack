# sns2slack
This program receives notifications from AWS SNS over HTTPS, formats them, and posts them to a Slack channel or other compatible HTTPS endpoint. This allows sending real-time notifications from AWS GuardDuty and similar services that are quicker and easier to read.

##### *This program is a work in progress.* 

It has been released under the MIT license to avoid any barriers to personal or corporate use. However, please consider creating a PR if you make improvements to the code.
